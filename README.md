<h2>E-commerce</h2>
<p>You are creating the front-end of an online shop. Specifically, you will be responsible for creating a back-office, where administrators can add and edit products.</p>
<p>Today's goal is to connect a static interface to the API so that you can receive products, create new ones, edit them once created, and delete them as needed.</p>
